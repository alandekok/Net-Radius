On Debian systems, all the bundled dictionaries are placed in
/usr/share/libnet-radius-perl/dicts.

Documentation is placed in /usr/share/doc/libnet-radius-perl/ as per
the Debian Policy.

For other distributions or under manual installation, you may need to
locate those files manually according to your needs.
