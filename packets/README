This directory contains RADIUS packets that have been processed by the
bin2packet script included in the contrib/ directory of this
distribution.

Packets can be added to this directory simply, by issuing the
following command:

  $ cd packets
  $ bin2packet dump

Where 'dump' is a file containing a RADIUS packet (payload), as
extracted by ethereal.
