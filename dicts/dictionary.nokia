#       Enable by putting the line "$INCLUDE dictionary.nokia" into
#       the main dictionary file. Don't forget to comment out the
#       $INCLUDE dictionary.ascend, because these over-lap with the
#       standard RADIUS attributes, which are also illegitimately used
#       by Ascend.
#
#	It's apparently rocket science for people to define their own
#	VSA's.
#

#
#	The format of this attribute is binary coded decimal (BCD)
#	with the last four bits all set to 1 if there are an odd
#	number of digits,
#
#	e.g 123 is encoded as hexadecimal bytes 21 F3
#
#	This is an incredibly stupid way of encoding the data.
