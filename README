Net::Radius Modules

The modules included here provide an interface to the RADIUS
protocol. It consists of the following modules:

Net::Radius::Packet	- Deals with RADIUS packets
Net::Radius::Dictionary	- Deals with RADIUS dictionaries

This module is essentially the original RADIUS-1.0 distribution by
Christopher Masto plus a number of changes and fixes by Luis Munoz and
Ian Smith.

It has been changed so that it better fixes the CPAN namespace. See
the other README.* files in this archive for additional information.

The installation follows the standard protocol...

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ make install

The ./examples directory contain a number of simple examples.

This code supports the use of vendor specific attributes. This
type of attribute is defined in RFC-2138 and is used to support
'propietary' extensions on top of the base RADIUS specification.

There are two new kinds of entries in the RADIUS dictionary in
order to specify VSAs.

VENDORATTR <vendor> <attribute> <id> <type>

This entry is used to create a new kind of vendor attribute,
such as in this example

VENDORATTR 	9 	cisco-avpair 	1 	string

This creates a new vendor-specific attribute for vendor 9 (Cisco
Systems), with name 'cisco-avpair'. This attribute is identified by
numeric id '1' and is associated with a string value.

The second type of entry allows the specification of named values.
The following is an hypotetical example of named value entry.

VENDORATTR	9	cisco-enum	254	integer
VENDORVALUE	9	cisco-enum	Value-1	1
VENDORVALUE	9	cisco-enum	Value-2	2
VENDORVALUE	9	cisco-enum	Value-3	3

About the stability, this code has been in very active use at a
largish ISP with hundreds of thousands of users using a variety of
network equipment with impressive results. It has been succesfully
used under FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris and Tru64.

A sample dictionary file is included, mostly to ilustrate the syntax
of the expected file.

Enjoy...
