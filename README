Net::Radius Modules
===================

The modules included here provide an interface to the RADIUS
protocol. It consists of the following modules:

Net::Radius::Packet	- Deals with RADIUS packets
Net::Radius::Dictionary	- Deals with RADIUS dictionaries

This module is essentially the original RADIUS-1.0 distribution by
Christopher Masto plus a number of changes and fixes by Luis Muñoz and
Ian Smith.

It has been changed so that it better fits the CPAN namespace. See the
other README.* files in this archive for additional information.

The installation follows the standard protocol...

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ make install

The ./examples directory contain a number of simple examples.

This code supports the use of vendor specific attributes. This
type of attribute is defined in RFC-2138 and is used to support
'propietary' extensions on top of the base RADIUS specification.

There are two new kinds of entries in the RADIUS dictionary in
order to specify VSAs.

VENDORATTR <vendor> <attribute> <id> <type>

This entry is used to create a new kind of vendor attribute,
such as in this example

VENDORATTR 	9 	cisco-avpair 	1 	string

This creates a new vendor-specific attribute for vendor 9 (Cisco
Systems), with name 'cisco-avpair'. This attribute is identified by
numeric id '1' and is associated with a string value.

The second type of entry allows the specification of named values.
The following is an hypotetical example of named value entry.

VENDORATTR	9	cisco-enum	254	integer
VENDORVALUE	9	cisco-enum	Value-1	1
VENDORVALUE	9	cisco-enum	Value-2	2
VENDORVALUE	9	cisco-enum	Value-3	3

About the stability, this code has been in very active use at a
largish ISP with millions of users using a variety of network
equipment with impressive results. It has been succesfully used under
FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris and Tru64.

There's copious support material along with this distribution. Please
do take a look.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

I have no control on the machanisms involved in the storage or
transport of this distribution. This means that I cannot guarantee
that the distribution you have in your hands is indeed, the same
distribution I packed and uploaded.

Along the distribution file, you should have a file with the extension
".asc". This contains a GPG "detached signature" that makes it
impossible for anybody to alter this distribution. If security is of
any concern to you, by all means verify the signature of this file and
contact the author if any discrepancy is detected.
