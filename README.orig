README for RADIUS modules

This is a very quick initial release to get some comments on the
package and see if it turns out to be useful to anyone else.

Please read the RADIUS::Packet manpage for details, and an example of
how to open the network socket.  There are several examples included
(example-<blah>.pl) which demonstrate how to do a few things.. they
will be cleaned up considerably for a future release.

You can also do accounting.. basically just open the radacct port
instead of radius, and send back an Accounting-Response (no
attributes) when you've saved the Accounting-Request.

See also the file README.VSA in the distribution for notes about VSA 
support.

Please contact me if you have any problems or comments with this release.
